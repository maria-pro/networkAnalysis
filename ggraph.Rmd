## `ggraph` and `tidygraph` packages

While `igraph` and `statnet` packages are "classic" for working with networks, rather recent developments include `ggraph` and `tidygraph` packages:

-`ggraph` extension to ggplot2 for graph analysis

- `tidygraph` provides a way for `dplyr` to interact with graphs

let's start with `ggraph`, but before let's dig further into visualization.

## Effective network graphic design

What makes networkgraph layouts easier to understand and interpret?

- Minimize edge crossings.

- Maximize the symmetry of the layout of nodes.

- Minimize the variability of the edge lengths.

- Maximize the angle between edges when they cross or join nodes.

- Minimize the total space used for the network display

**Force-directed approach**: a flexible and powerful approach to automatic network layouts.
It iteratively minimize the total energy in a network:

- connect nodes to have a spring-like attractive force, while simultaneously assigning repulsive forces to all pairs of nodes. 

- The springs pull connected nodes closer to one another, but the repulsive forces push unconnected nodes away from each other. 

**The goal for any network graphic design should be to **
------

- **produce a figure that reveals the important or interesting information that is contained in the network data.**

### `ggraph` 

R is FANTASTIC, but when visualizing networks, it lacks .. as time and effort are required to produce "nice" graphs

```{r}
g_got<-read_graph("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schochastics/netViz/master/data/GoT/gotS1.graphml", format="graphml")

plot(g_got)
```
Does not look nice...

While in other visualization aspects R has a "winner" - `ggplot2` packages.

`ggraph` marries the `ggplot2` winning approach to the world of networks:

`ggraph`=`ggplot2 of networks`

We are also going to use `graphlayouts` package, which introduces additional useful layout algorithms to R. 

`ggraph` uses the same underlying principles of the grammar of graphics. So, if you are familiar with them, you can skip the next section!

**Grammar of graphics**: a framework which follows a layered approach to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner. 

[This link](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) provides a more in-depth explanation of the grammar of graphics

---------

Let's have a brief look at out graph: 

`autograph()`: quickly shows an overview of your network data. 
```{r}

autograph(g_got)
```

`ggraph` works with layers, where each layer adds a new feature to the plot and builds the final grapg step-by-step. 

```{r}
got_palette <- c("#1A5878", "#C44237", "#AD8941", "#E99093", "#50594B")

ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape=21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family="serif")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette)+
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2,3))+
  scale_size(range = c(1,6))+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Let's have a closer look:

**Layout**: calculates a layout. 

The `layout` parameter specifies the algorithm to use. The `stress` layout is part of the `graphlayouts` package. It produces nice layouts for almost any graph. 

```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")
```

To recollect: some other layout algorithms of igraph.
```{r eval=FALSE}
c("layout_with_dh", "layout_with_drl", "layout_with_fr", 
  "layout_with_gem", "layout_with_graphopt", "layout_with_kk", 
  "layout_with_lgl", "layout_with_mds", "layout_with_sugiyama",
  "layout_as_bipartite", "layout_as_star", "layout_as_tree")
```
To use them, you just need the last part of the name.
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggraph(routes_graph,layout = "dh")+
```

**Edges**: second layer specifies how to draw the edges

```{r eval=FALSE}
geom_edge_link0(aes(width = weight),edge_colour = "grey66")

```

Edges can be drawn in many different ways as the list below shows.

```{r eval=FALSE}
c("geom_edge_arc", "geom_edge_arc0", "geom_edge_arc2", "geom_edge_density", 
  "geom_edge_diagonal", "geom_edge_diagonal0", "geom_edge_diagonal2", 
  "geom_edge_elbow", "geom_edge_elbow0", "geom_edge_elbow2", "geom_edge_fan", 
  "geom_edge_fan0", "geom_edge_fan2", "geom_edge_hive", "geom_edge_hive0", 
  "geom_edge_hive2", "geom_edge_link", "geom_edge_link0", "geom_edge_link2", 
  "geom_edge_loop", "geom_edge_loop0")
```

HINT: for a standard network plot stick with `geom_edge_link0`: it draws a straight line between the endpoints.

With `geom_edge_link0`, the appearance of the edge can be specified by mapping edge attributes to aesthetics or setting them globally for the graph. 

Mapping attributes to aesthetics is done within `aes()`: 

- the edge width is mapped to the edge attribute `weight.` 

- the colour of all edges is set to `grey66.`

We can use the following aesthetics within `geom_edge_link0` either within `aes()` or globally:

- `edge_colour` (colour of the edge)

- `edge_width` (width of the edge)

- `edge_linetype` (linetype of the edge, defaults to “solid”)

- `edge_alpha` (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)

`ggraph` does not automatically plot arrows if your graph is directed: use `arrow` parameter.

```{r eval=FALSE}
geom_edge_link0(aes(...),..., 
                arrow = arrow(angle = 30, length = unit(0.15, "inches"),
                              ends = "last", type = "closed"))
```                              
                              
The default arrowhead type is “open”, but “closed” usually has a better appearance.

**Nodes**

```{r eval=FALSE}
geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu, size = size),shape = 21)+
geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family = "serif")
```

The `node` layer should always go above the `edge` layer. Otherwise, edges will be visible on top of nodes. There are slightly less geoms available for nodes.

c("geom_node_arc_bar", "geom_node_circle", "geom_node_label", 
"geom_node_point", "geom_node_text", "geom_node_tile", "geom_node_treemap")

The most used ones:

`geom_node_point()`: equivalent of `ggplot2::geom_point()` for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes.


```{r}
gr <- create_notable('bull') %>%
  mutate(class = sample(letters[1:3], n(), replace = TRUE))

ggraph(gr, 'stress') + geom_node_point()
```

`geom_node_point()` option can set using `aes()` or globally:

- `alpha`: opacity; a value between 0 and 1

- `colour`: colour of shapes 0-20 and border colour for 21-25

- `fill`: fill colour for shapes 21-25

- `shape`: node shape; a value between 0 and 25

- size: size of node

- stroke: size of node border

Possible shapes for the nodes can include:

![Shapes for nodes](img/points-symbols.png)

*Shapes 1-20*: to change the color of shapes 1-20 use the `colour` option 

*Shapes 21-25*: use `fill.` 

`geom_node_text()`:  to add node labels. It is similar to `ggplot2::geom_text()` and `ggplot2::geom_label()`.

Options for `geom_node_text()`:

- `label`: attribute to be displayed as node label

- `colour`: text colour

- `family`: font to be used

- `size`: font size

The `filter` parameter allows you to specify a rule for when to apply the aesthetic mappings. This is most commonly used for node labels, but can also be used for edges or nodes. 

**Scales**

```{r eval=FALSE}
scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette)+
scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2,3))+
scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,6))

```

The `scale_*` functions: control aesthetics that are mapped within `aes()`.

Steps:

- map variables to aesthetics with `aes()`

- change appearances with `scale_` 

This layer can be skipped but generally you use `aes()` to map attributes for further use in the `scale_*` functions.

```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape = 21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family="serif")+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
To work out the variable type you can use the table below:


Aesthetic	| Variable type	|Description
---|---|---
node | size |	continuous	
edge |	width	|	continuous	
node colour/fill	|	categorical/continuous	|	use a gradient for continuous variables
edge colour	|	continuous	|	categorical only if there are different types of edges
node shape	|	categorical	|	only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice
edge |	linetype	|	categorical	only if there are a few categories (1-5). Colour should be the preferred choice
node/edge alpha	|	continuous	

For `ggraph` colours are assigned in the order of the unique values of the categorical variable. They are usually set as `factors` or if it is a character, then sorting the unique values.

To have more control over colours you can use a vector with colours

```{r eval=FALSE}
got_palette2 <- c("5" = "#1A5878","3" = "#C44237","2" = "#AD8941",
                  "1" = "#E99093", "4" = "#50594B")
```

`scale_fill_manual(values = got_palette)`

To select colours you can use this [link](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/)

Compare

```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width=Weight),
                edge_colour="grey66")+
geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),
                shape=21,col="grey25")+
scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.1,1.5))+
scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,8))+
theme_graph()+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```

and

```{r}
got_palette2 <- c("5" = "#1A5878","3" = "#C44237","2" = "#AD8941",
                  "1" = "#E99093", "4" = "#50594B")

ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width=Weight),
                edge_colour="grey66")+
geom_node_point(aes(fill=clu,size=size),
                shape=21,col="grey25")+
scale_edge_width_continuous(range=c(0.1,1.5))+
scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,8))+
scale_fill_manual(values=got_palette2)+
theme_graph()+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```
For easy colour selection you can also use `scale_fill_brewer()` and `scale_colour_brewer()` from `ggplot2`. You can see the palettes they offer at [colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) .

.
```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape = 21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family = "serif")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")+
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2,3))+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,6))+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Some popular palettes include

Type | Palettes
---|---
Diverging | BrBG, PiYG, PRGn, PuOr, RdBu, RdGy, RdYlBu, RdYlGn, Spectral
Qualitative | Accent, Dark2, Paired, Pastel1, Pastel2, Set1, Set2, Set3
Sequential | Blues, BuGn, BuPu, GnBu, Greens, Greys, Oranges, OrRd, PuBu, PuBuGn, PuRd, Purples, RdPu, Reds, YlGn, YlGnBu, YlOrBr, YlOrRd


**themes**: control the overall look of the plot (e.g. axis, background, grids, etc.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
theme_graph()+
theme(legend.position = "none")
```

`theme_graph()`: remove the default `ggplot` theme

`theme(legend.position = "none")`: controls the legend. Possible options are "none", "left", "right", "bottom", "top", or two-element numeric vector.


```{r}
ggraph(g_got,layout = "stress")+
  geom_edge_link0(aes(edge_width = Weight),edge_colour = "grey66")+
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = clu,size = size),shape = 21)+
  geom_node_text(aes(filter = size >= 26, label = name),family = "serif")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuBu")+
  scale_edge_width_continuous(range = c(0.2,3))+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,6))+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

### `tidygraph` package

The `tidygraph` package provides a tidy framework to easily manipulate different types of relational data, including: graph, network and trees.

In the tidygraph framework, network data are considered as two tidy data tables, one describing the node data and the other is for edge data. The package provides a simple solution to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them.

You will learn methods for detecting important or central entities in a network graph. We’ll also introduce how to detect community (or cluster) in a network.

### Tidy data -> Tidy network data

**Tidy data** approach relies on 3 rules which make a dataset tidy

- Each variable must have its own column.

- Each observation must have its own row.

- Each value must have its own cell.

Can we code network data in this way?

Relational data -> single *tidy* data frame ?

But

nodes data -> tidy data = tidy data frame

edges data -> tidy data = tidy data frame

2 tidy data frames -> `tbl_graph` object

## The tbl_graph object

Working with `tidygraph` is based on using `tbl_graph` objects
What is happening:

`igraph`: keep the node and edge data in a list and creating igraph objects

`tidygraph`: subclasses igraph with the `tbl_graph` class to work in a tidy manner.

- ensures that all`igraph` features will work with `tbl_graph` objects. 

To create `tbl_graph` objects use `tbl_graph()` function and providea node data.frame and an edge data.frame. It also works with : 

- data.frame

- list

- matrix 

- igraph object (`igraph`)

- network object (`network`)

- and LOTS of others (see [this](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygraph/tidygraph.pdf))

```{r}
mtcars_matrix <- cor(t(mtcars[,c(1,3:6)]))

mtcars_clust <- hclust(dist(mtcars[,c(1,3:6)]))


mtcars_graph<-as_tbl_graph(mtcars_clust)

mtcars_graph


iris_clust <- hclust(dist(iris[1:4]))
iris_tree <- as_tbl_graph(iris_clust)
iris_tree
```

## How it works

**Old way**: 

`tidygraph` introduces new functions as well as allows to use traditional `tidyverse` functions:

`mutate_nodes()` = `mutate (..., target = 'nodes)`

`filter_edges()`= `filter (..., target = 'edges')`

`arrange(..., target = 'nodes') `

**New way**:

Use a **pointer**  to let the data object itself do all manipulation.

This pointer is changed using the `activate()`. You can use `nodes` and `edges` (from `ggraph`) or `vertices` and `links`.

```{r}
mtcars_graph %>% activate(edges)

#Can extract the active data as tibble if needed
as_tibble(mtcars_graph) %>% head()
```
Additionally, you can use `.N()`  to gain access to the node data *while manipulating the edge data*. 

or 

`.E()` to use the edge data when on the node data

or 

`.G()` to get access to the `tbl_graph` object itself.

### `tidyverse` functions 

`filter()`/`slice()` on node data remove the edges terminating at the removed nodes. 

`arrange()` on nodes changes the indexes of the to and from column in the edge data.

`dplyrs` is supported but requires rows to maintain their identity (due to relation structure). 

e.g. summarise() and do() are not allowed - the change in node and edge data

ps: you can apply them to a tibble representation of the data and then joining the result back in.

`join` is supported, but `to` and `from` column should be referencing existing nodes.

Additionally, we can use `bind_nodes()` and `bind_edges()`  to add nodes / edges to the graph. 

`bind_graphs()` combines multiple graphs in the same graph structure, but cannot create edges between the merged graphs

```{r}
library(ggraph)
graph1 <- create_notable('diamond') %>% 
    mutate(name = letters[1:4])
plot(graph1)
graph2 <- create_star(5) %>% 
    mutate(name = letters[4:8])
plot(graph2)

# Plot
graph1 %>% bind_graphs(graph2) %>% 
    ggraph(layout = 'kk') + 
    geom_edge_link() + 
    geom_node_point(size = 8, colour = 'steelblue') +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), colour = 'white', vjust = 0.4) + 
    ggtitle('Binding graphs using `bind_graphs`') + 
    theme_graph()
```
vs

`graph_join()`merges nodes using a `full_join()` and keeps the individual edges from both graphs

```{r}
graph1 %>% graph_join(graph2) %>% 
    ggraph(layout = 'kk') + 
    geom_edge_link() + 
    geom_node_point(size = 8, colour = 'steelblue') +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), colour = 'white', vjust = 0.4) + 
    ggtitle('Joining graphs using `graph_join`') + 
    theme_graph()
```
