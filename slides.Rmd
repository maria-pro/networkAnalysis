# Well - let's warm  up ...

In the center of the river, there lay 2 islands that were connected to each other and the river banks by 7 bridges.

Is there a route that would allow someone to cross all 7 bridges without crossing any of them more than once?

# Seven Bridges of Königsberg

Leonhard Euler:

![](img/le.jpeg)


*"... this type of solution bears little relationship to mathematics, and I do not understand why you expect a mathematician to produce it..."*

... and then ...

*"...This question is so banal, but seemed to me worthy of attention in that [neither] geometry, nor algebra, nor even the art of counting was sufficient to solve it."*

## **... NO SOLUTION!!!!**

and then... in 1875, the people of Königsberg decided to build a new bridge...

# Why Network Science?

If you have any of these questions:

- What are the elements in the system?

- What are the role of those elements in the system?

- What are the processes/interactions that build systems?

- What are the dynamics of changes in the system?(e.g. spread of the disease, etc.)

---
# Why Network Science?

understanding how people, entities, structures are connected

how ... interact

how ... that influence the change in ... across space and time

### **Overall**: use network analysis if you need to understand the **system**: 
  
  = how **interactions** or **connections** between **components** make up a **system**

# Applications 

social networks - any!

- humans and animals

- ecological communities and populations

- personality traits

- biological systems: genes regulation systems, metabolic systems

- ANY SYSTEM

### a collection of vertices, V, and edges, E.

# Key concepts:

![](img/graph.png)

A **graph** is a number of points that are connected by lines. 

Each point is usually called a **vertex** = node (more than one are called **vertices** = nodes)

Lines are called **edges**.
---
# Key concepts:

![](img/graph.png)

**Incident**: Any edge is incident to 2 vertices.

x is incident to A and E. 
---
# Key concepts:

![](img/graph.png)

**Adjacent**: Adjacent vertices are connected by an edge.

G is adjacent to D, F, and H because there is some edge going from G to all these other vertices. 
---
# Key concepts:

![](img/graph.png)

**Isolated**: B is isolated because it’s not connected to any other vertices

---
# Key concepts:

![](img/graph.png)

**Degree**: The degree is just the number of connections a vertex has

A has a degree of 2, B has a degree of 0, and F has a degree of 4.

# Key concepts:

# Key concepts:

**Weight**: a value representing the length of the edge.

# Ways to represent graphs

### non-linear data structure (the visual representation) -> linear data structure ???

---
# Edge lists


unordered list of edges


![](img/edgeList.png)

Practical, but not efficient for really dense graphs

# Adjacency lists

![](img/adjus.jpeg)
**Adjacency lists**: lists out the connections for each vertex

An **adjacency matrix** is a matrix representation of exactly which nodes in a graph contain edges between them

# Example

![](img/example.png)
---

# Questions to ask about a network:

- How large the network is?

- How densely connected is it? 

- Is the network made up of one or more distinct groups?

- How compact is the network?

- How clustered are the network members?

# Measures

## Graph measures

## Node measures

## Edge measures

# R Packages

This tutorial we will use:

- `igraph`

- `statnet`

Also
- `tidygraph`

- `ggraph` 

Let's talk about them briefly to dig into more details in the practical part.

---

#`igraph` package

['igraph'](https://igraph.org/) is a collection for creating and manipulating graphs and analyzing networks. 

- written in C and also exists as Python and R packages.

- [`igraph` package](https://igraph.org/r/)

**Resources**:

[Manual](https://igraph.org/r/doc/aaa-igraph-package.html)

[Discussion group](https://igraph.discourse.group/)

[StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/igraph)


---

#`statnet` package

['statnet'](http://statnet.org/) is a collection of R packages for 

- management, 

- exploration, 

- statistical analysis, 

- simulation and 

- vizualization of network data. 

- based on [Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_random_graph_models).  

---

#`ggraph`

[`ggraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/) is an extension of `ggplot2` for graph visualizations

- use the same layer by layer philosophy as`ggplot2` = grammar of graphics

**Resources**:

[Vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/index.html)


---

# `tidygraph`

[`tidygraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygraph/) is a tidy API for graph manipulation

- Provides a way for dplyr to interact with graphs

---

# Datasets

[`networkdata` package](http://networkrepository.com/): a large collection of dataset for network science from wide variety of areas

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("schochastics/networkdata")
library(networkdata)

```

```{r eval=FALSE}

#to see the list of datasets
data(package = "networkdata")
```

---

# Network Data objects

Types of information:

**Nodes**: list of nodes in network + node labels (Required)

in `statnet` =vertices

**Ties**: list of ties in the network (Required)

**Node attributes**: attributes of the nodes (Optional)

**Tie attributes**: attributes of the ties (Optional)

**Metadata**: other information about the entire network
`statnet` = global information about the network (e.g. directed or not directed, are loops allowed, etc.)
